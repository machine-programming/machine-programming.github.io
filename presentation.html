            <p>
                Oral presentations are a key component of this course, worth 10% of your grade.
                They provide an opportunity to develop communication skills and share insights with your peers.
                Each presentation will be 25 minutes total, including ~15 minutes for the presentation and ~10 minutes for questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will start the presentation from the 6th week of the course.
                You can sign up for a presentation slot by filling out a <a href="#" target="_blank">signup sheet</a>.
                Each student can sign up for topics; each topic can be presented by at most 2 students.
                Students can then choose specific papers to present from the list of topics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The presentation is graded on a completion basis.
                You will receive a full score if you properly present the material in class.
                Extra credit will be given for exceptional presentations.
